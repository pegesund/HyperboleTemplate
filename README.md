# A starter template for Hyperbole

This is a starter template for the (hyperbole)[https://github.com/seanhess/hyperbole] project.

It includes setup for:

- Database pool with hasql
- Config template
- Logging with hslogger

It replicates the basic starter project in the hyperbole readme, but with these features implemented (effectful)[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/effectful]

Here you go, up and running with all you need.. Now there is no excuse for not starting to code!
